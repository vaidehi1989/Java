  12.a spolling:Acronym forsimultaneous peripheral operations on- line, spooling 
	refers to puttingjobs in ab u ff er, a special area inmemor y or on adisk where 
	adevic e cana ccess them when it is ready. Spooling is useful because devices
 	accessdata at different rates. The buffer provides a waiting station where 
	data can rest while the slower device catches up.

24.b.Job Control Language (JCL) is a scripting language used on IBM mainframe 
operating systems to instruct the system on how 
to run a batch job or start a subsystem

25.c.It allows system software to utilize features such as virtual memory,
paging, safe multi-tasking, and other features designed to
increase an operating system's control over application software.

26.d.In protected mode the segment_part is replaced by a 16 bit selector, the 13 upper bits (bit 3 to bit 15) of the selector contains the index of an entry inside a descriptor table. The lowest two bits define the privilege of the request, from 0 to 3 where 0 has the highest priority and 3 the lowest. The remainder bit specifies if the operation is against the GDT or a LDT.

The descriptor table entry contains

the real linear address of the segment
a limit value for the segment size
some attribute bits (flags)

34.a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) is a computer system call in DOS computer operating systems 
that returns control to the system as if the program has quit, but keeps the program in memory

There is a wide variety of technical performance metrics that indirectly affect overall computer performance.
a).Instructions per second
b).FLOPS
c).Performance per watt
